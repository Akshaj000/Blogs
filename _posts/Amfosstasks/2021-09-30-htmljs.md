## [Task-08 (Exploring JS)](https://github.com/Akshaj000/amfoss-tasks/tree/master/task-08)
Before learning this task, I learned basics of java script and a little of html.
### [Click ME](/Htmltask/page-2/form.html)
## [Page 1](/Htmltask/page-2/form.html)
I managed to correct most of the bugs. I basically googled on most of the commented lines and figured out what action is, how to make a button work, how to use forms etc. I couldnt stop that next button from loading. I tried but i failed. Other than that ig my website works fine. Heres a [link](/page-2/form.html) to the page 1.

## [Page 2](/Htmltask/page-3/index.html)
Page-2 was easy for me since i learned java script basics. I still googled a lot. I added click on function to each button. And i wrote the code on [js file](https://github.com/Akshaj000/amfoss-tasks/blob/master/task-08/page-2/js/index.js).

## [Page 3](/Htmltask/page-4/chart.html)

I did as per the instructions. Its working.
