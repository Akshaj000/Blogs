## [Task-05 (Let me see)](https://github.com/Akshaj000/amfoss-tasks/tree/master/task-05)

Ive never learned or debugged c file before. c was similar to c++ but a lot of methods were different. This task took me some time to complete. Removing syntax errors was easy, i used google for keywords and functions that was new to me. I was lazy to complete it properly but after few weeks i got back into the task used, print and scan statement to go through each line by line. I didnt know the game was hangman since i have never played it before, yeah ik its strange. You can find my code [here](https://github.com/Akshaj000/amfoss-tasks/blob/master/task-05/letmesee.c). Ive pasted my outputs below.

### Output :
