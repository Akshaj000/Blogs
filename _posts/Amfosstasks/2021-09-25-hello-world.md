**Hello world**, this is my first blog post on the tasks i attempted to join Amfoss.
I will start with first few tasks that i did and post the remaining in the upcoming days.


## [Task-00 (installing Ubuntu 20.04)](https://github.com/Akshaj000/amfoss-tasks/tree/master/task-00)

  I was using ubuntu for last 2 years for my school works since my old laptop was a potato and windows worked terrible in it. I had ubuntu in my syllabus for more than 5 years. Even though the universe showed me the way, i failed to see it. I started using terminal for installations , changing themes, and other tweaks only like an year before. I always loved to see terminal in action.
I switched to windows since my laptop came with it as default. I showed a little hesitation to switch back to ubuntu at first. I tried wsls and virtual machines but i couldnt get the old satisfaction. Doing these tasks actually made me switch back to ubuntu instantly and now im a full time user.


I had to disable secure boot, etc..  while installing ubuntu in my old laptop but this time it was so easy. I only had to plug in my usb and restart. I installed iso file from ubuntus official website and used rufus to flash to a pendrive. I didnt watch any tutorials since ive done it before. I allocated 128gb freespace in which i installed ubuntu.

## [Task-02  (Beginning my journey with linux and git)](https://github.com/Akshaj000/amfoss-tasks/tree/master/task-02/Coordinates-Location)
 I should thank amfoss for making us understand git and github. Git is a nessesary skill every geeks need. Even this website is an example. In this task i had to go through basic terminal commands like mkdir,ls,cd,touch,vi,cat etc. It took me a little time to undertand git properly. I accidentaly deleted all my tasks in my first attempt. I still have a lot of useful git commands to learn.
 
### Here are some of the terminal commands which come in handy:
~$ cd location                                       (to change directory)\
~$ ls                                                (to list directories and files for given location parameter else the current directory by default)\
~$ mkdir directory-name                              (to make directory)\
~$ touch filename                                    (to create any files)\
~$ cat > filename                                    (to add text to file)\
~$ cat filename                                      (to view file)\
~$ vi filename                                       (to view and edit files)\
~$ cat file1 file2 .... > file0                      (to combine files)\
~$ sudo mv location1/filename1  location2/filename2  (to move or rename file)\
~$ sudo cp location1 location2                       (to copy and paste the file)
### Some of the git commands:
~$ git init                                          (to initiate a new project)\
~$ git status                                        (to display the state of working directory and staging area)\
~$ git add filename                                  (adds a file to staging area, . is  used to add all files in the project directory)\
~$ git origin url                                    (to specify the remote repository the project is cloned from and to be pushed to)\
~$ git branch branch-name                            (to add new branch)\
~$ git checkout branch-name                          (to switch branch)\
~$ git commit -m "message"                           (to move files from a staging area to commit)\
~$ git push origin branch-name                       (to upload local repository to a remote repository)
